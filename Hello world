This unique HTML code creates a simple yet visually appealing webpage using only HTML and CSS. It features a gradient background, a stylish header, and a card element with hover effects that slightly enlarges when the mouse is placed over it. The button inside the card is interactive, displaying a pop-up alert when clicked. The design combines modern UI elements such as rounded corners, shadows, and smooth transitions, making the webpage look clean, attractive, and user-friendly without needing any external libraries.
